# Playbooks are YAML files containing a series of directives to automate the provisioning of a server.

# The following example is a simple playbook that perform two tasks: updates the apt cache and installs vim afterwards.

# YAML relies on indentation to serialize data structures. For that reason, when writing playbooks and especially when copying examples, you need to be extra careful to maintain the correct indentation.
