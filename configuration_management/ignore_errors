# This shows two conditional tasks based on the output from a php -v command.

# We will test for the exit status of the command, since we know it will fail to execute in case PHP is not installed on this server.

# The `ignore_errors` portion of the task is important to make sure the provisioning continues even when the command fails execution.

# The debug module used here is a useful module for showing contents of variables or debug messages. It can either print a string (when using the msg argument) or print the contents of a variable (when using the var argument).
